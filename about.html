                <h3> Hello!</h3>

                <p> My name is ZoieAnn Baird and I am a multimedia artist and designer.
                    I am a Digital Media: Visual Imaging Major from Northwest Missouri State University.
                    I am also the founder of Missing Socks Studios, an animation and webcomic studio
                    specializing in fantasy and adventure. I was born and raised in Saint Joseph, Missouri,
                    and started my art journey at 10 years old. I have always had a creative spark from a
                    young age. I was very involved in dance, music, and theatre growing up,
                    and was always had a designers eye.</p>

                <p> I love exploring different styles and media. Some of my favorites include animation,
                    oil painting, and character design. I have a great ability to be able to replicate
                    multiple styles of artwork closely. My artwork ranges from multiple different styles such as realism,
                    to more stylized pieces of work. I aim to expand this even more in the future! </p>


                <p> Thank you for coming to support my page!</p>
