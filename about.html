        <h3> Hello!</h3>

        <p> My name is ZoieAnn Baird and I am a multimedia artist and designer.
            I am a Digital Media: Visual Imaging Major from Northwest Missouri State University.
            I am also the founder of Missing Socks Studios, an animation and webcomic studio
            specializing in fantasy and adventure. I was born and raised in Saint Joseph, Missouri,
            and started my art journey at 10 years old. I have always had a creative spark from a
            young age. I was very involved in dance, music, and theatre growing up,
            and was always had a designers eye.</p>

        <p> I love exploring different styles and media. Some of my favorites include animation,
            oil painting, and character design. I have a unique ability to b able to replicate
            multiple styles of artwork closely. My artwork ranges from multiple different styles
            and I aim to expand this even more in the future! </p>


        <p> Thank you for coming to support my page!</p>
